# Old Republic Professional Website QA Automation Project
I'm creating a project that will test the Old Republic Professional's main website in different ways by creating test cases and automation scripts in an organized and ordered way.

## Project Overview
Automated UI testing suite for the Old Republic Professional insurance website (https://www.oldrepublicpro.com/)




## List of Files and What They Do
Requirements.txt
- Lists all Python Packages your project needs
- It's a shopping list for your project's dependencies
- After you run "pip install -r requirements.txt", pip reads the file and installs all packages listed.
